      <p>Way back from 2023 to 2024, I worked as a sales clerk at Urban and a cashier at a Chinese store. At Urban, I assisted customers with their purchases, organized shelves, and helped maintain a clean, welcoming store environment. I also provided product recommendations and contributed to meeting sales targets. Though my main role wasnâ€™t cashiering, I occasionally helped operate the POS during busy hours. Meanwhile, at the Chinese store, I was fully in charge of the cashier duties handling payments, giving correct change, and balancing the register. I also supported the team by bagging items, stocking products, and keeping the counter area clean. Working in both fast-paced settings helped me become more responsible, detail-oriented, and customer-focused. I learned to communicate clearly, work under pressure, and adapt to different kinds of customers. These experiences greatly improved my confidence and prepared me for future roles in retail or customer service.</p>
